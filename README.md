# Dotfiles

I use https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm to manage my dotfiles.

# Neovim

I use neovim. Most of my configuration I got from https://github.com/amix/vimrc. I changed a bunch of stuff to better suit my workflow.

# Tmux

I'm an avid user of tmux. I use the tmux plugin system with tpm (https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm). I can strongly recommend it.

# Git

My gitconfig is not really that extensive, I'm a basic user.
